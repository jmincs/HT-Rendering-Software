# The official home for the Pixel Streaming servers and frontend!
The frontend and web server elements for Unreal Pixel Streaming (previously located in `Samples/PixelStreaming/WebServers`) are now in this repository, for all to contribute to. They are referred to as the **Pixel Streaming Infrastructure**.

## Goals

The goals of this repository are to:

- Increase the release cadence for the Pixel Streaming servers (to mitigate browser breaking changes sooner).
- Encourage easier contribution of these components by Unreal Engine licensees.
- Facilitate a more standard web release mechanism.
- Grant a permissive license to distribute and modify this code wherever you see fit (MIT licensed).

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to our repository, please reference our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). Thank you for your time and your efforts!

## Contents

The Pixel Streaming Infrastructure contains reference implementations for all the components needed to run a pixel streaming application. They are structured as separate projects, which work together, but are designed to be modular and interoperable with other implementations which use WebRTC technology. These implementations include: 
- A signalling web server, called Cirrus, found in [`SignallingWebServer/`](SignallingWebServer/).
- An SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit), found in [`SFU/`](SFU/).
- A matchmaker, found in [`Matchmaker/`](Matchmaker/).
- Several frontend projects for the WebRTC player and input, found in [`Frontend/`](Frontend/):
  - shared libraries for [communication](Frontend/library/) and [UI](Frontend/ui-library/) functionality
  - separate [implementations](Frontend/implementations/) using different technologies such as TypeScript or React/JSX

  For detailed information, see the [/frontend](/Frontend/).

## Releases
We release a number of different components under this repository, specifically:

- Container images for the signalling server
- NPM packages for the frontend
- Source releases of this repo with the reference frontend built as a minified js bundle

### Container images

The following container images are built from this repository:

- [[Unofficial] pixel-streaming-signalling-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/pixelstreamingunofficial/pixel-streaming-signalling-server/tags)
- [[Unofficial] pixel-streaming-sfu](https://hub.docker.com/r/pixelstreamingunofficial/pixel-streaming-sfu/tags)

### NPM Packages

## Versions

We maintain versions of the servers and frontend that are compatible with existing and in-development version of Unreal Engine. 

:warning: **There are breaking changes between UE versions - so make sure you get the right version**. :warning:

<ins>For a list of major changes between versions please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).</ins>
