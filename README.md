# HT-Rendering-Software

A open-access webapp to navigate 3D Holotomography images controlled by standard mouse and keyboard inputs as well as VR through WebXR.

## Features

- __Uploading:__ Users can upload TomoCube Files (TCF) of any size.

- __Processing:__ Upon uploading, Python's h5py library extracts the data from the file's '3D' group into texture (.tga) files.

- __Staging:__ Once a file is uploaded, users can stage the file to be displayed through Unreal Engine's Pixel Streaming Plugin. Only one file can be staged at a time.


## Development

- Developed and tested on Windows 11.
- Designed from Unreal Engine 5.4.

## Dependencies

Development was done on Python 3.12. The project dependencies are shown in requirements.txt. You can download them at once in the project's root directory with shell command:
```bash
pip install -r backend/dependencies.txt
```

## Setup

The frontend component can be run as follows:
```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```

The backend server can be run as follows:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
Each server must be ran on separate terminals. This can be done with keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift +`.

The frontend will be accessible in a browser at http://localhost:3000 after proper setup.
